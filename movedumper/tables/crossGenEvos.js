/* This file contains a small table for the pre-evolutions of Pok√©mon evolutions introduced in PLA or Gen 9.
 * We need to check the pre-evolution data for these separately, as there are many moves that their pre-evolutions
 * can learn that aren't available as TMs in Gen 8/9, and are thus missing from the evolutions' Showdown data.
