# Move Changes

A significant number of moves have been adjusted in some way; this can range from number changes to their power and accuracy, to totally new effects in some cases.

## New Moves

A few entirely new custom moves have been added to the game. These are all signature moves for specific Pokémon.

## Move Modifications

The table below shows what parameters were changed on what moves. The numbers shown in bold are the new values, and the number in brackets are the old values. For effect chances, N/A denotes this move didn't previously have an effect chance.

In addition to this, all **damaging** moves that match one of the user's types now gain a 10% boost to their accuracy. For example, a Granbull using Play Rough would have 99% accuracy instead of 90%. However, a Vileplume using Sleep Powder would still have 75% accuracy.

## Move Modernization

Some moves have had their effects updated to match how they work in newer generations.

Move|Update
---|---
Whirlwind|Updated to Gen 5+ effect.
Roar|Updated to Gen 5+ effect.
Growth|Updated to Gen 5+ effect.
Toxic|Updated to include never-miss effect for Poison-types.
Teleport|Updated to Gen 8+ effect, except that it ends a wild battle no matter who uses it.
Minimize|Updated to sharply raise evasion as in Gen 5+.
Rapid Spin|Updated to Gen 8+ effect.
Hidden Power|Now always at 60 power. (Type is still dependent on IVs).
Knock Off|Now doubles to 130 power while the foe has an item held (unless the foe holds a Griseous Orb or has the Multitype ability). The actual 'knock off' effect still works the same as Gen 4, where the item just becomes disabled instead of deleted.
Feint|Updated to no longer fail if enemy isn't using Protect/Detect.
Chatter|Updated to always confuse the foe.

Conversion 2 and Beat Up are not able to be updated yet.
Tail Glow is **not** updated because of both technical restrictions and as a balancing act due to greater distribution.

## Move Inaccuracies

Some new moves added to the game couldn't be added completely accurately (yet?); some parts of their effects have been omitted or modified.

Move|Effect Change
---|---
Cotton Guard|This sharply raises Defense (+2) instead of drastically (+3) as I'm not sure how to make it be so; this is also somewhat for balance.
Echoed Voice|This uses the same consecutive damage increase effect as Fury Cutter. Other Pokémon using Echoed Voice do not contribute to the damage increasing.
Freeze-Dry|This move is not super effective against Water-types and as such will display "not very effective". However, it *does* do 4x damage to anything that is Water-type, so the damage should work out the same as the real deal.
Aurora Veil|Instead of being a field effect of its own, the move sets up Reflect and Light Screen in one turn. It still has the Hail requirement and works with Light Clay.
Ice Spinner|This move has no additional effect as terrains don't exist.
Raging Bull|This cannot change type and will always be Normal-type. It can still break screens.
