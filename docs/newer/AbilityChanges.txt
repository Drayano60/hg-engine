Ability Modernization
===========================================================================
Thanks to hg-engine, most abilities that gained new battle effects in later generations have had these changes backported to HG/SS.
As hg-engine is still an ongoing project, some abilities have not been fully modernized yet. However, the majority of these are fairly niche interactions.

Please note that this only applies to the battle effects of these abilities.
Field effects are currently unchanged, so abilities with field effects introduced after HG/SS (e.g. Flash Fire, Harvest) do not currently work.

[Abilities Fully Modernized]
- Air Lock now shows a message when the Pokémon enters battle.
- Anger Point no longer activates if the Pokémon takes a critical hit while it has a substitute.
- Cloud Nine now shows a message when the Pokémon enters battle.
- Drizzle's rain now only lasts for five turns, or eight with a Damp Rock attached.
- Drought's sun now only lasts for five turns, or eight with a Heat Rock attached.
- Effect Spore can no longer activate in response to an attack from a Grass-type Pokémon.
- Flash Fire now activates even if the Pokémon is frozen when hit by a Fire-type move.
- Forecast will now cause Castform to revert to its base form if suppressed or removed.
- Frisk now shows the items of both opponents in a double battle.
- Intimidate's effect now no longer works on Pokémon with Inner Focus, Oblivious, Own Tempo or Scrappy.
- Illuminate is updated, but has been changed further.
- Keen Eye is updated, but has been changed further.
- Leaf Guard now prevents Rest being used by the Pokémon in harsh sunlight.
- Minus and Plus now boost the Pokémon's Special Attack if their ally has either the Plus or the Minus ability.
- Normalize now also provides a 20% power boost to Normal-type moves.
- Sand Stream's sand now only lasts for five turns, or eight with a Smooth Rock attached. (It has also received further changes.)
- Serene Grace now also doubles the chance of the flinching effects of the King's Rock and Razor Claw items.
- Simple now doubles stat changes on application, instead of just during damage calculation.
- Skill Link now makes Triple Kick only check accuracy once.
- Sniper now changes critical damage to x2.25 instead of x3.0.
- Snow Warning now summons snow which lasts for five turns, or eight with an Icy Rock attached.
- Stench now applies the additional 10% chance of flinch to moves that do not already flinch.
- Sturdy now prevents a Pokémon at full HP from being knocked out in one hit.
- Technician now also boosts the power of Struggle.

[Abilities Partially Modernized]
- Lightning Rod now stops Electric-type moves dealing damage and boosts the Pokémon's Special Attack stat. However, it doesn't currently boost the Special Attack stat if the Pokémon is already immune to Electric-type moves.
- Magic Guard no longer prevents the Pokémon from being poisoned by Toxic Spikes. However, it does still prevent the Pokémon from being fully paralyzed.
- Oblivious protects the Pokémon from Taunt, but it won't cure an existing Taunt if gained afterwards.
- Synchronize can now also reflect bad poison, but otherwise works the same as Generation IV.
- Trace is now unable to copy certain abilities, but otherwise works the same as Generation IV.
- Wonder Guard now prevents a non super-effective Fire Fang from passing through, but cannot block Beat Up, Doom Desire or Future Sight.

[Abilities Not Yet Modernized]
- Anticipation, Klutz and Stall still work exactly the same as Generation IV.
- Flower Gift is still not tied to Cherrim's ability to transform.
- Guts still gives a damage boost if a frozen Pokémon uses a self-thawing move.
- Hustle and Rivalry still boost the damage a Pokémon inflicts on itself from confusion.
- Mold Breaker does not cause a Pokémon with Levitate that is pulled in by the Mold Breaker's Pokémon's Roar/Whirlwind to be affected by Spikes or Toxic Spikes.
- Multitype still prevents the item removing effects of moves (except for Knock Off).
- Own Tempo, if given to a confused Pokémon, still cures the Pokémon immediately instead of after its turn.
- Pickup still works the same as Generation IV (i.e. it has no in-battle effect).
- Pressure still works the same as Generation IV.
- Soundproof still prevents a Pokémon in reserve from being affected by Heal Bell (as well as the new Healing Chime ability).
- Speed Boost still raises Speed on a turn that the Pokémon failed to run from a wild encounter.
- Sticky Hold still prevents an item from being stolen even if the Pokémon was KOed that turn.
- The abilities that prevent status (Immunity, Insomnia, Limber, Magma Armor, Vital Spirit, Water Veil), if suppressed or removed, will still cure the relevant status on the Pokémon if the Pokémon is switched out.

===========================================================================

- Pastel Veil mostly works correctly, but there may be some edge cases involving Mold Breaker that are inaccurate.
- Stance Change now relies on the use of Protect, as King's Shield isn't currently available.

===========================================================================
Unavailable Abilities
===========================================================================
There are also some abilities that are unavailable, even though Pokémon that have them are available. These ability slots have all been replaced, but if using the patch without ability changes, then slots with these abilities either duplicate other slots or are set to be no ability.

The affected abilities are the following:
Cud Chew, Magician, Mimicry, Mirror Armor, Neutralizing Gas, Power of Alchemy, Ripen, Stakeout, Stalwart, Symbiosis.
