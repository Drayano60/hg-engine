-------------------
Move Changes
-------------------
Aurora Crystal features moves from the original Heart Gold and Soul Silver as well as additional moves. On top of this, the numerical values of all moves have been updated to be as they are as of Scarlet & Violet. Move effects have also been modified to match Scarlet & Violet where possible; these are explicitly listed as a move change.

Some moves have also received further changes which are listed below. Changes are shown relative to a move's values after being updated to modern generation mechanics.

-------------------
Critical Hits
-------------------
In Aurora Crystal, a critical hit still deals double damage (or triple damage if the Pokémon has the Sniper ability). This can't currently be changed to the x1.5 rate for technical reasons.

The probability of critical hits has been adjusted to be somewhere between Generation 4 and modern generations due to the higher damage per crit. The new probability rates for each critical hit stage are as follows (before the arrow is standard HG/SS, after the arrow is the new value):

Stage +0: 1/16 ⟶ 1/24
Stage +1: 1/8 ⟶ 1/8
Stage +2: 1/4 ⟶ 1/3
Stage +3: 1/3 ⟶ 1/2
Stage +4: 1/2 ⟶ 1/1

As a reminder, a Pokémon can raise its critical rate stages in the following ways:

+0:
- This is the standard stage that all Pokémon have by default.

+1:
- Using a move with a high chance of landing a critical hit, such as Slash, Leaf Blade, Night Slash etc.
- Holding a general item that boosts critical hit rate, such as the Razor Claw or Scope Lens.
- Having the Super Luck ability.

+2:
- After using the move Focus Energy, or consuming the Lansat Berry, or having the item Dire Hit used on it. (Only one of these works at a time.)
- If the Pokémon is a Chansey, by holding the Lucky Punch item.
- If the Pokémon is a Farfetch'd, by holding the Leek item.

There are no ways to instantly achieve the +3 or +4 stages, but all of these effects are additive. For example:
- A Honchkrow with Super Luck (+1), that holds a Scope Lens (+1) and uses Night Slash (+1) will have a 50% chance to cause a critical hit that does DOUBLE damage.
- A Kingdra that has used Focus Energy (+2), that holds a Scope Lens (+1) and has the Sniper ability will have a 50% chance to cause a critical hit that does TRIPLE damage.
- A Farfetch'd that holds a Leek (+2) and has used Focus Energy (+2) will have a 100% chance to cause a critical hit that does DOUBLE damage.

As with other stats, boosts to the critical hit rate are lost upon switching out (with the exception of Baton Pass, where the Pokémon that switches in receives the boosts).

-------------------
Status Conditions
-------------------
Some status conditions have been modified to better fit their modern generation counterparts.

- Confusion:
A Pokémon that is confused still has a 50% chance to hit itself each turn (this could not be changed to 33% because of some technical complications). To compensate for this, a Pokémon will stay confused for 1-3 of its turns (down from 1-4), and then snap out of confusion on its following turn.

- Burn:
A Pokémon that is burned will take damage equal to 1/16 of its max HP (down from 1/8) at the end of each turn.

- Paralysis:
A Pokémon that is paralyzed has its effective speed halved in battle (instead of quartered).

- Sleep:
A Pokémon will now be fast asleep for 1-3 (down from 1-4) of its turns, and then wake up and attack on its following turn.

-------------------
Newly Added Moves

Aurora Crystal contains 114 new moves in addition to the 467 in Heart Gold and Soul Silver normally. 109 of these are moves that were introduced in later generation games, and the remaining 5 are custom signature moves for a few Pokémon.

-------------------
New Moves
-------------------

Soothing Aroma
-------------------
Soothing Aroma is a new signature move for Meganium.
It's a status Grass-type move with 100% accuracy and 20 PP that targets both opponents.
Any Pokémon hit by this move will have its Attack and Special Attack lowered by 1 stage.

This move is inspired by Meganium's Pokédex entries mentioning it can "calm aggressive feelings".

Infernal Blast
-------------------
Infernal Blast is a new signature move for Typhlosion.
It's a special Fire-type move with 100 base power, 75% accuracy and 5 PP that targets all Pokémon on the field.
Any Pokémon hit by this move has a 50% chance of becoming burned.

The move is inspired by Typhlosion's Pokédex entries mentioning it can "rub its blazing fur together to cause huge explosions". The "Infernal" part of the name is also a parallel to Hisuian Typhlosion's Infernal Parade move.

Savage Rend
-------------------
Savage Rend is a new signature move for Feraligatr.
It's a physical Water-type move with 80 base power, 100% accuracy and 10 PP that targets one Pokémon.
Any Pokémon hit by this move will have its Defense lowered by 1 stage.
This move has 33% increased power (becoming 106 BP) if used by a Pokémon with Strong Jaw.

This move is inspired by Feraligatr's Pokédex entries mentioning it "savagely tears its victim up".

Piddly Punches
-------------------
Piddly Punches is a new signature move for Ledian.
It's a physical Bug-type move with 10 base power, 90% accuracy and 10 PP that targets one Pokémon.
This move will continue hitting until it either misses or has hit 10 times in a row.
Each hit of this move has 33% increased power (each hit becomes 13 BP) if used by a Pokémon with Iron Fist.

This move is inspired by Ledian's Pokédex entries mentioning it throws a large quantity of "piddly" punches. Mechanically, it's based on (but not identical) to Maushold's Population Bomb.

Splash Crash
-------------------
Splash Crash is a new signature move for Wailord.
It's a physical Water-type move with variable power, 100% accuracy and 10 PP.
It targets a single other Pokémon on the field.
The power of this move depends on the weight difference between user and target (using the same formula as Heavy Slam). Its damage is doubled if used against a target that has used Minimize.
This move becomes a fixed 120 BP if used by a Pokémon with the new Huge Impact ability (which Wailord also has).

This move is inspired by Wailord's Pokédex entries mentioning it can "knock out opponents with the shock created by breaching and crashing its big body into the water". It's a Water-type clone of Heavy Slam.

-------------------
Move Effect Updates
-------------------

Moves With New Effects
--------------------------------------
The following moves have been given new effects:

- Cut/Dragon Claw/Drill Peck/X-Scissor:
These moves now have a high critical-hit ratio.
Dragon Claw and X-Scissor have this effect pulled from Legends: Arceus.

- Dive:
This is now a one-turn move (with no additional effects).

- Draining Kiss:
This now heals the user by 50% of the damage dealt (instead of 75%).

- Hail:
In addition to the normal effects of a hailstorm, the Defense stat of Ice-types is now boosted by 50% while the hailstorm is active (inherited from Gen 9's snowy weather).
Pokémon that are not Ice-types will still take 1/16 HP damage each turn.

- Meditate:
This now boosts both the user's Attack stat and accuracy by one stage each.

- Needle Arm:
This now adds a layer of Spikes to the target's field if it hits.
It no longer has a chance to poison.

- Power Gem:
This now has a chance (10%) to lower the target's Special Defense by 1 stage.

- Rage Fist:
This instead works like the move Rage, where the user's Attack is boosted if it gets hit after using Rage Fist.
The actual effect can't currently be implemented.

- Razor Wind:
This is now a one-turn move.
It still has a high critical-hit ratio.

- Triple Kick:
This now gains +15 base power on each consecutive hit (raised from +10).

- Strength:
This now has a chance (20%) to boost the user's Attack stat by one stage.

Moves Updated Accurately
--------------------------------------
The following moves have had their effects updated to work as they do in later generations:

- Chatter:
This now always confuses the opponent.

- Defog:
This now removes entry hazards (Spikes, Toxic Spikes, Stealth Rock) on both sides of the field instead of just the opponent's.

- Growth:
This now boosts both Attack and Special Attack by one stage. In sunlight, it boosts them by two stages instead.

- Feint:
This attack can still hit even if the opponent doesn't use Protect or Detect.

- Hidden Power:
This is now fixed at 60 base power. The type is still determined by the user's IVs.

- Jump Kick/High Jump Kick:
The crash damage is now always equal to half of the user's maximum HP (rounded down).

- Minimize:
This now boosts evasion by two stages instead of one.

- Phazing Moves (Roar/Whirlwind):
In wild battles, the move will now always fail if the user is of a lower level than the target.
In trainer battles, the move will always succeed.
These moves now ignore Protect and Detect.

- Rapid Spin:
This now boosts the user's Speed stat by one stage in addition to its hazard removal.

- Role Play:
This is now unable to copy Flower Gift, Forecast, Illusion, Imposter, Trace and Zen Mode (in addition to Multitype and Wonder Guard).

- String Shot:
This now drops the targets' Speed stat by two stages instead of one.

- Sweet Scent:
This now drops the targets' evasiveness by two stages instead of one.

- Substitute:
A Pokémon behind a Substitute can now be attacked directly by any sound-based moves (Hyper Voice, Growl, etc.) or by any Pokémon with the ability Infiltrator.

- Teleport:
Now switches out the user in a Trainer battle, has -6 priority. Ends wild battles.

- Toxic:
Now always hits if used by a Poison-type Pokémon.

- Uproar:
Now always lasts for exactly three turns.

Moves Updated Semi-Accurately
--------------------------------------
The following moves have their effects somewhat updated to work as they do in later generations, but some parts are missing or inaccurate:

- Binding Moves (Bind/Clamp/Fire Spin/Magma Storm/Sand Tomb/Whirlpool/Wrap):
The target now takes damage equal to 1/8th of its max HP each turn, and the duration is four to five turns (the binding effect then ends on the next turn with no damage dealt).
If the user is holding a Grip Claw, the duration is fixed at six turns instead of the seven it should be (the binding effect then ends on the next turn with no damage dealt).
Due to the way the Gen 4 game engine handles the binding status, it cannot currently be any longer than six turns of damage.

- Encore:
The effect of Encore now always lasts for 3 turns (instead of 3-7), NOT including the turn it gets applied. The effect will then wear off at the end of the third turn.
This differs slightly from Scarlet & Violet, where it applies for three of the target's actions, so the total amount of turns will depend on the Encore user's Speed stat.
Additionally, in a double battle, a Pokémon under the effect of Encore is still unable to choose the target of their attack (as is the case in regular HG/SS) as this can't be changed currently.

- Dragon Rush:
This now does double damage if the opponent has used Minimize. However, it is not a guaranteed hit in that case.

- Fury Cutter:
This now reaches its maximum damage after three uses (instead of five) like in later generations.
However, in Gen 4, Fury Cutter will retain its damage boost even if you swap to a different move (as long as that different move doesn't fail for whatever reason).
It's currently unknown how to change this so it is still the case in Aurora Crystal; Fury Cutter's maximum power has been nerfed to compensate.

- Knock Off:
This now deals double damage if the target has a held item (unless the item is the Griseous Orb, or the target has the Multitype ability).
However, it still "disables" the item during the battle instead of outright deleting it, as the item would otherwise be lost permanently.

- Taunt:
The effect of Taunt now always lasts for 3 turns (instead of 3-5), NOT including the turn it gets applied. The effect will then wear off at the end of the third turn.
This differs slightly from Scarlet & Violet, where it applies for three of the target's actions, so the total amount of turns will depend on the Taunt user's Speed stat.

Moves Not Updated
--------------------------------------
The following moves have NOT had their effects updated (generally due to not knowing how to do so yet) and still work as they do in Heart Gold and Soul Silver:

(Note: This may not be an exhuastive list; if a move's effect did change between generations and it's not mentioned anywhere, then there's a very good chance it still acts the same as it does in HG/SS normally. If you do find a case like this, please let me know and I'll add it to the list!)

- Aromatherapy:
This still cures Pokémon behind a substitute, does not list the Pokémon that are healed, and cannot activate an ally's Sap Sipper ability.

- Baton Pass:
If a Pokémon under the effect of Mean Look uses Baton Pass, the Pokémon that comes out is also under the effect of Mean Look (which is not the case as of Gen 5).

- Beat Up:
This still uses the original damage calculation.

- Conversion 2:
The effect is still based on the last move the Pokémon was hit with.

- Destiny Bond:
This does not have a chance of failing on consecutive uses.

- Doom Desire/Future Sight:
These moves still deal typeless damage (so are not affected by STAB and do not deal super effective damage) and are unaffected by Life Orb. The damage is still calculated when the move is selected.

- Explosion/Self-Destruct
These moves still calculate the damage dealt based on half of the target's Defense stat. (This particular aspect has been kept in the game intentionally, and the move description has been updated to match.)

- Me First:
Me First still cannot be used by a Pokémon under the effects of Taunt.

- Multi-strike Moves:
Moves such as Icicle Spear, Double Slap etc still have a 37.5% chance to hit 2 times, 37.5% to hit 3 times, 12.5% to hit 4 times and 12.5% to hit 5 times.

- Pay Day:
This move still determinines the payout based on the Pokémon's level when the move was used, not whatever it is at the end of battle.

- Psych Up:
This does not copy the target's critical hit ratio.

- Psywave:
This still deals damage based on its original damage formula from Gen 4.

- Stomp:
This does not have a guaranteed hit against minimized targets.

- Tail Glow:
This does not boost the user's Special Attack by 3 stages; it still only boosts Special Attack by two stages.

- Tailwind:
The effect of Tailwind still only lasts for 3 turns (including the turn where it is used). This can't currently be increased to four turns due to the way the game keeps track of Tailwind turns.

- Wish:
This still heals for 50% of the recepient's max HP instead of 50% of the user's max HP.

New Moves Added Inaccurately
--------------------------------------
The following moves brought in from later generations have not been implemented completely accurately (and were not intentionally changed):

- Aurora Veil:
It sets up a Reflect and Light Screen in the same turn, instead of it being its own field effect. However, the damage reduction should be the same. It still has the restriction of only working within Hail.

- Cotton Guard:
This boosts the user's Defense by two stages, instead of three stages.

- Echoed Voice:
This instead acts like Fury Cutter where each individual Pokémon has its own consecutive use counter (as opposed to any Pokémon using Echoed Voice during the turn increasing the damage).
However, also like Fury Cutter (in Gen 4), Echoed Voice will retain its damage multiplier even if the Pokémon uses a different move, unless that move misses or fails for whatever reason.
As usual, the move begins at 40 BP and gains an extra 40 BP for each consecutive use. Due to the above, it now caps at 120 BP (3+ uses) instead of the 200 BP it normally would.

- Freeze-Dry:
This is not super-effective against Water-types, but it does do quadruple damage against Water-types for roughly the same result.

- Horn Leech:
This works almost entirely fine, but can still be used even under the effects of Heal Block.

- Ice Spinner:
This now has no additional effect, as terrains don't exist in this game.

- Pollen Puff:
This works almost entirely fine, but is not currently blocked by Heal Block (whether a Pokémon uses it on their ally or vice-versa).

- Raging Bull:
This is now always a Normal-type move. Paldean Tauros isn't in the game anyway though!

- Scale Shot:
The stat change happens after the first hit instead of the last, but the move is otherwise the same.
