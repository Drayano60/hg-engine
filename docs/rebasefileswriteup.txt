SEQs

Need to set these back up again:


[be_seq stuff]

Other?
* Sheer Cold (might as well put ice immunity in type calc instead)
* Razor Wind's guaranteed critical hit chance
* Using the new stuff for the weather moves/abilities - is that fine?
* Hurricane shared Thunder's eff before (152), but can probably code this correctly now so haven't reimplemented that
* Going to redefine Assault Vest in CalcAccuracy instead and make the move fail there if it's a status and is not Me First

AI Changes?
* Strength Sap (previously used #32 be_seq for Recover etc)
* Move Reckless calculation back into CalcDamage (and hence remove it from be_seqs 45, 198, 262, 269, 293?)
* Coil, Hone Claws, new Meditate, Victory Doad (previously using #050 for +2 Atk moves)
* Cotton Guard (previously using #051 for +2 Def moves)
* Tail Glow, Quiver Dance, Shell Smash, Work Up (previously using #053 for +2 SpAtk moves)
* Noble Roar, Tearful Look (previously using #058 for -2 Atk moves)
* Aurora Veil (previously using #065 for Reflect)
* Toxic Thread and Toxic (previously using #066 for regular poison moves)
* Final Gambit (previously using #142 for Belly Drum)
* Meteor Beam (previously using #145 for Skull Bash)
* Chilly Reception (previously using #164 for Hail - this has changed quite a bit so might need to reimplement this one differently)
* Shift Gear and Tidy Up (previously using #212, Dragon Dance)
* Parting Shot (uses U-turn AI, 228)

Bugs?
* Does Toxic's be_seq (33) allow it to hit Pok√©mon underground/in the air, even if the user isn't Poison-type?
* The guaranteed crit effect (282) seems incorrect...?

Moved damage calculation?
I've left these for now but I had the damage boost in the general calc function before so the AI could see it.
* Knock Off (188)
* Venoshock (280)
* Hex (287)
* Acrobatics (289)
* Barb Barrage (306)
* Stored Power (320)
* Rage Fist (321)

eff_seqs now overwritten...
* !! Noble Roar used (292) !!
* Psyshock used (293) but can check move ID instead
* Sacred Sword used (295) but can check move ID instead
* Body Press used (296) but can check move ID instead
* !! Incinerate used (297) !!

* !! Aurora Veil used (303) !!
* !! Steel Beam used (304) !!

* Triple Axel used (307). This is now (298) and I've added the loaded dice/skill link part
* !! Esper Wing used (308) !!
* Freeze Dry sans freeze used (309) but is no longer required
* !! The new Piddly Punches used (310) !!
* Toxic Thread used (311) [but did get an AI related shift]
* !! The new Needle Arm/Ceaseless Edge used (312) !!
* !! The haphazard Echoed Voice used (313) !!
* Fire Fang remake used (314) but is no longer required
* !! Clear Smog used (315) !!
* !! Final Gambit used (316) !! [but did get an AI related shift]
* !! Meteor Beam was (317) !! [but did get an AI related shift]
* !! Pollen Puff was (318) !!
* !! Poltergeist was (319) !!
* !! Parting Shot was 322 !! [but did get an AI related shift]
* Thief/Covet was copied to (323) for AI reasons
* 324/325 are unused custom moves
* !! Strength Sap was (326) !! [but did get an AI related shift]
* !! The new Thunder Claw was (327) !!
* !! Dire Claw was (328) !!
* !! Chilly Reception was (329) [but did get an AI related shift]
* !! A haphazard Triple Arrows was (330)
* !! Spirit Shackle was (331)
* !! Sparkling Aria was (332)
* !! Alluring Voice was (333)
* !! Burning Jealousy was (334)
* !! First Impression was (335) - copy of Fake Out script w/o the flinch, to avoid Sheer Force boost

[sub_seq stuff]

Other?
* The sleep numbers in 018.s are different to what I had before - is that more accurate?
* Abandoned the change to the duration of confusion - need to update docs to match
* I did not re-add the Thief/Covet change that limits it to wild battles, docs need editing to match.
* I left off the Sand Stream/Snow Warning weather immunity for now.
* Changed the Defiant/Competitive implementation in Memento (129) slightly, might need to test again.
* Readded Sweet Veil to Yawn (141) differently, might need to test message.
* Did not readd Volt Tackle 50% recoil (147).
* Maybe re-test Tailwind + Wind Rider interaction?
* Need to get Defog (171) to clear terrains!
* Psychic Noise doesn't display a can't heal message? (173)
* Have ignored changes to weather due to new implementation (183, 184, 185, 252)
* Removed constants.s import from (186). Does it still compile?
* Killed the Anticipation changes in (194)
* Aurora Veil subseq (439) is still checking for hail
* Erased the content of 441-446 (except 444)
* Erased the content of 449-450 and 454 (Armor Tail/Dazzling/Queenly Majesty) as there's probably a better way to print it
* May need to redo Sunny Mood (452) a little due to the weather changes
* Erased the content of (455) as I've abandoned the Anticipation changes
* Erased (460) and (461) and (466) as weren't used anymore
* Incinerate (467) probably doesn't burn the Roseli Berry currently
* Is the new Sweet Aroma (470) still checking and failing on foes with Sweet Aroma?
* Chilly Reception (481) is still coded for hail instead of snow
  
Bugs?
* Poison sub_seq seemed to use anti sleep message for Flower Veil, has been corrected
* I haven't done the case where an ally has Sweet Veil but the Rest user has Mold Breaker

Moved?
* Competitive is (335) in the main branch, not (442). I previously had Noble Roar here (with Defiant/Competitive handling) which is now in (488)

[data/graphics/overworlds]
- I haven't readded the Mega Stone sparkles that were on 1453.png.

[data/graphics/sprites]
The following Pokemon have differences from the base hg-e:

- Vaporeon, Jolteon, Snorlax, Tyranitar (uses Platinum sprites)
- Togekiss (uses a custom backsprite)
- Pikachu Cosplay (copied to use regular Pikachu sprite)

[src/pokemon.c]
- Removed the Time's Gift stuff
- Removed the guaranteed 3 31 IVs for starters

[src/individual/SwitchInAbilityCheck.c]
- weather abilities no longer have text that says they were activated, i may need to redo this. the printpreparedmessage in their sub_seqs is also a bit buggy
- need to make sure snow warning activates whatever i want too
- did not re-add text_on_ability_entry flag, using one of the ones already in instead
- did not change slow start to 3 turns
- did not readd anticipation change

[src/individual/CheckDefenderItemEffectOnHit.c]
- need to deal with contact check for Long Reach (sticky barb + rocky helmet)
- may need to re-add u-turn checks to air balloon, rocky helmet, weakness policy
- may need to check rocky helmet text
- may need to check weakness policy text (cell battery sub_seq seems to be on 339 and 344?)

[src/individual/CalcBaseDamage.c]
- did not readd knock off damage boost
- did not reapply slow start change
- did not reimplement grass pelt change
- did not reimplement rhythmic (probably want to change it to a metronome clone)
- did not readd reckless boost here (still in battle_eff_seq)
- implemented cacophony at a x1.3 boost
- beware of snow implementation, didnt change stuff back
- did not reimplement selfdestruct/explosion defense cut

[src/field/overworld_table.c]
- Did not readd mega stone sparkles

[src/battle/other_battle_calculators.c]
- did not reimplement slow start buff

- did not reimplement echoed_voice_count thing
- did not reimplement the AI check for type effectiveness of paralysis moves + stun spore. will need to come back
- did not reimplement Forecast's Adaptability effect
- did not yet reimplement Freeze Dry, should wait until Sheer Cold bit is there
  
[src/battle/battle_script_commands.c]
- did not revert knock off flag status thing this time - removeitem should be ok with the new item changes
  
[src/battle/battle_pokemon.c]
- may need to come back to this once flags are sorted. may not need to do any changes?

[src/battle/ability.c]
- changed implementation of armor tail/dazzling/q majesty, will need to check text, likely broken for allies
- removed the anticipation changes
- moved isMoveContact into battle_pokemon.c
- was more thorough with WanderingSpriitAbilityCheck

[include/pokemon.h]
- just used changed_Ability_slot for ability patch func, should be ok

[include/battle.h]
- didn't include most stuff here as its no longer needed. only really add stat_up_3 and stat_raised_flag

[armips/data/moves.s]
- defined FLAG_SOUND to get it to compile but it shouldn't be used elsewhere
