still needs sorting:
✓ i think i completely missed out MoveHitDefenderAbilityCheck (Magma Skin etc...)
- ai changes (including thief/covet?)
- fix toxic so non poisons cant hit through dig/fly
✓ do i want to readd Knock Off to the damage calc?
✓ need to re-add population bomb/pdidly punches effect (or at least assign it?)
✓ echoed voice needs redoing
✓ chilly reception is still broken due to the weather changes
✓ defog should clear terrains
✓ proper messages for weather abilities + sunny mood
✓ INCINERATE VS roseli berry
✓ I haven't done the case where an ally has Sweet Veil but the Rest user has Mold Breaker
- what do about metronome (the move) calling moves that arent ready? (TBD)
- mega stones lol (placement, ow sprite etc) (bigger project)
✓ new implementation for the rhythmic ability
- reckless in damage calc again? (to do later)
✓ reconcile hail vs snow stuff
- deal with preparedmessage in weather seqs?
  
stuff to check:
✓ check sleep turns
✓ check memento vs defiant (text is still bugged but not my problem)
✓ check yawn vs sweet veil
✓ tailwind vs wind rider (but i haven't done the switch-in with an active tailwind part)
✓ new implementation of priority blocking abilities
✓ sweet aroma vs allies? script looked like it checked sweet aroma rather than same team
✓ Poison sub_seq seemed to use anti sleep message for Flower Veil, has been corrected
✓ check weakness policy/rocky helmet work right
✓ uturn interactions vs items covered in CheckDefenderItemEffectOnHit (longer one). didnt readd to air balloon, rocky helmet and weakness policy. havent tried with the other items
✓ does ability patch work correctly
