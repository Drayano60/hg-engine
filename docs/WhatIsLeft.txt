Essentials:
- [ ] Do a pass over all Trainers, introduce Gen 7-9 mons to teams etc. Need to also sort out teams for E4 rematches, possibly Gym Leader rematches?
- [ ] Decide on the exact requirements on Arceus (at the very least, how many Pokémon need to be obtained.)
- [ ] Need to add OW sprites back for TM/HM item balls and for Mega Stones. Can't really do this until Blu's guide appears. Can probably use Tinke in a pinch...
- [ ] Figure out what to do about overworld sprites for Gen 9.
- [ ] Testing!!

Stretch Goals:
- [ ] Add content for the Fighting Dojo.
- [ ] Add new maps for the two new environments in the Safari Zone.

No Gen 9 mons currently have overworlds except for Sprigatito and the cross-gen evolutions (sans Kingambit).

Assets added:
- Bounsweet, Steenee, Rockruff, Pincurchin, Nymble, Lokix and Paldea Tauros front and back sprites from https://eeveeexpo.com/resources/1101/.
- Nymble, Lokix, Paldea Wooper and all Paldea Tauros icons from Pokémon Showdown.




Might need to sort out some of the rematch teams still?
