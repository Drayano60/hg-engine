- By default Aurora Crystal has not changed the types of any Pokémon.
- This is because of all of the debate and indecision and Luxray discourse etc etc and I'd rather just stick with the normal types now.
- Though does suck for the changes that have less friction. RIP to Ghost/Fairy Mismagius I'll miss you
- Since some people love type changes, you can apply an optional patch that adds a lot of them, along with some additions to level ups/TMs/tutor moves in some cases where the Pokémon's new typing isn't supported well by the default set.
- Level up moves are in addition to what they normally learn (so there might be cases where things learn two distinct moves at the same level etc).
- All type changes from Renegade are here.
- There's a few extra ones that were intended for Aurora Crystal originally.
- There's also two that were special requests.
