- Fresh Waters now recover 30 HP (down from 50 HP).
- Soda Pops now recover 50 HP (down from 60 HP).
- Lemonades now recover 70 HP (down from 80 HP).
- Energy Powders now recover 60 HP (up from 50 HP).
- Energy Roots now recover 120 HP (down from 200 HP).
- The King's Rock and Razor Claw now apply to all moves that do not already have a chance to flinch.
- The Soul Dew now provides a 20% boost to Latios or Latias's Dragon and Psychic moves instead of heavily boosting Sp. Atk and Sp. Def. Additionally, it now works inside battle facilities.
- The Power Weight, Bracer, Belt, Lens, Band and Anklet items now give 8 EVs of the relevant stat to a Pokémon holding it when defeating a Pokémon (up from 4 EVs).
- All vitamin items (Protein, Iron etc.) no longer have an 100 EV per stat cap and can be used until the stat is maxed. The EV cap for each stat is also reduced to 252 (from 255).
- All TMs can now be used an infinite amount of times, and cannot be sold.
- The Stick, Lunar Wing and Secret Potion are known as the Leek, Lunar Feather and Secret Medicine respectively (as is the case in Gen 8). Spelling is updated for all items.
- Evolution items that are normally for trade evolutions only can now be used like an evolution stone.

The following items are somewhat updated:
- The Grip Claw fixes the duration of a binding move to six turns instead of seven. (This is because the way the game stores the data means six is the maximum turns possible).
- The Life Orb now displays a message after it activates. However, the Life Orb's interaction with Future Sight and Doom Desire is unchanged, and the user is not damaged if attacking into a substitute.

The following items are not updated:
- All Poké Balls retain their catch rates from Gen 4. It's also unclear if the Moon Ball works on newly added Moon Stone evolutions (e.g. Eevee).
- Rare Candies cannot be used on a Lv. 100 Pokémon.
- X items still only raise a stat by one stage.
- Repels do not prompt you to use another one when they run out.
- Escape Ropes are still consumable items instead of a key item.
- The Figy, Wiki, Mago, Aguav and Iapapa Berries still recover 12.5% max HP when the Pokémon's HP reaches 50% or below.
- The Pomeg, Kelpsy, Qualot, Hondew, Grepa and Tamato Berries still eliminate all EVs for a stat if that stat has 110 EVs or lower.
- The Pomeg, Kelpsy, Qualot, Hondew, Grepa and Tamato Berries still give +2 friendship points if used on a Pokémon above 200 friendship.
- The Exp. Share still works as it does in Gen 4.
- The Mental Herb cannot cure the effects of Taunt, Encore, Torment, Heal Block or Disable (it still only affects Attract/Cute Charm).
- The Choice Band still boosts the damage of self-inflicted confusion damage.
- The Choice items do not cause a non-locked move to fail if the holder is somehow forced to use a different move.
- The Cleanse Tag's encounter rate reduction still applies even if held by a Pokémon with an ability that affects encounter rates (such as Illuminate).
- The Smoke Ball still guarantees escape if the player tries to run away on the same turn a Pokémon holding the Smoke Ball fainted.
- Shell Bell's effect still works even if the holder is afflicted by Heal Block or attacks into a substitute.
- The Focus Sash can still protect from multiple strikes of a multi-strike move.
- The Metronome still only boosts the power of a move by 10% for each consecutive use.
- A Flying-type holding an Iron Ball can still take super or not very effective damage from Ground-type moves depending on their secondary type.
- A Pokémon holding a Full Incense or Lagging Tail will still move after a Pokémon with the Stall ability.

-------------------
Gifts From Mom
-------------------
In HG/SS, if you allow Mom to save money for you, she'll occasionally use some of the money to buy you items. Some of these are recurring purchases for type resistance berries, while others are one-time purchases.

In an effort to reduce RNG, these gifts have been massively simplified and the original items moved elsewhere.

In Aurora Crystal:
* Any gift from Mom that would have been a type resist berry is now a Poké Doll.
* Any gift from Mom that would have been a unique one-time purchase is now a Rare Candy.

-------------------
TM Changes
-------------------
All TMs are now infinite use, similar to Generations 5-7. Additionally, they can no longer be sold to shops, or given to a Pokémon to hold.

If a TM is found on the floor in the overworld, it will be contained in a yellow Poké Ball, similar to Generation VI onwards.

Additionally, a number of TMs have had the move they contain changed. Some of the replaced moves are no longer available, while others have been shifted to a Move Tutor instead.

The changed TMs are as follows (the move after the arrow being the one used in the game):
- TM01: Focus Punch ⟶ Hone Claws
- TM03: Water Pulse ⟶ Psyshock
- TM05: Roar ⟶ Snarl
- TM09: Bullet Seed ⟶ Venoshock
- TM21: Frustration ⟶ Dazzling Gleam
- TM27: Return ⟶ Low Sweep
- TM28: Dig ⟶ Leech Life
- TM32: Double Team ⟶ Play Rough
- TM34: Shock Wave ⟶ Sludge Wave
- TM43: Secret Power ⟶ Flame Charge
- TM49: Snatch ⟶ Echoed Voice
- TM55: Brine ⟶ Scald
- TM62: Silver Wind ⟶ Acrobatics
- TM63: Embargo ⟶ Nasty Plot
- TM67: Recycle ⟶ Smart Strike
- TM70: Flash ⟶ Mystical Fire
- TM78: Captivate ⟶ Bulldoze
- TM83: Natural Gift ⟶ Work Up
- TM88: Pluck ⟶ Air Slash

-------------------
Poké Mart Changes
-------------------
The inventories of the standard Poké Mart that changes as you gain gym badges have been edited. Generally, many of the redundant items such as singular status healing items have been removed in favour of giving access to Max Revives and PP restoration items.

The standard Poké Marts stock the following items (with the amount of badges required in brackets):
- [0] Poké Ball
- [3] Great Ball
- [5] Ultra Ball
- [0] Potion
- [1] Super Potion
- [3] Hyper Potion
- [7] Max Potion
- [8] Full Restore
- [0] Ether
- [3] Max Ether
- [5] Elixir
- [7] Max Elixir
- [3] Revive
- [8] Max Revive
- [0] Full Heal
