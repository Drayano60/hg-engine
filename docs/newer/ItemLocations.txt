===========================================================================
Item Containers
===========================================================================
In addition to the standard Poké Balls, hidden items and NPC gifts, there's a couple new ways to find items.

As per later generations, any TMs or HMs are contained in a yellow Poké Ball instead.
If you spot one of these, you can be sure that a TM is inside.

A number of 'Berry Trees' have been added. These use the same sprite as Apricorn Trees, but without an apricorn inside.
Checking these will yield berries, and may sometimes contain several different berries at once.
The items given by Berry Trees will regenerate each time you challenge and win the Pokémon League.

===========================================================================
Pokémon Improvement Items
===========================================================================
Items to improve your Pokémon can be purchased at the Supply Counter (the middle one) at the back of any Pokémon Center.
Some of these are freely available for purchase, while others are limited and require League Points (LP).
You can earn 5 LP when defeating one of Johto's Gym Leaders, and an additional 10 LP upon reaching Indigo Plateau.

You can purchase the following items with money from any Supply Counter:

Vitamins: HP Up, Protein, Iron, Calcium, Zinc, Carbos.
EV Training Items: Power Weight, Power Bracer, Power Belt, Power Lens, Power Band, Power Anklet.
Other Items: Exp. Share, PP Up.

You can exchange LP for the following items at any Supply Counter:

Bottle Cap: Exchange 2 LP at the Supply Counter.
Ability Capsule: Exchange 3 LP at the Supply Counter.
Any Mint Item: Exchange 4 LP at the Supply Counter.
Ability Patch: Exchange 5 LP at the Supply Counter.

After becoming the Champion, this will swap to a money-based store, and any remaining LP will be refunded via Nuggets.
The items listed above can then be purchased for $10,000, $15,000, $20,000 and $25,000 respectively.

Ability Capsules, Ability Patches and mints can be used on Pokémon from the menu.
Bottle Caps can be exchanged to max out an IV in a Pokémon's stat at the Battle Counter (the right one).
