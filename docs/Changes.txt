Introduction
✓ Changed the title screen logo and background (a/0/4/6), and the cry (overlay_60).
✓ Changed the background of the intro bits to Soul Silver's (a/1/2/0).
✓ Changed the text on the initial intro screen to introduce Aurora Crystal.
✓ Professor Oak's text is changed a bit to shorten it and also detach the character selection from the player's self.
✓ The Running Shoes are now given in Script File 149 (which is run before the game starts), giving the player access to them instantly.
✓ Flags 283, 284, 285 and 286 are set just below the running shoes, giving the player access to the Bag, Trainer Card, Save and Options buttons on the bottom screen.

New Bark Town - Player's House
✓ The mother's dialogue is changed a bit. She now gives you the Bicycle, GB Sounds and Pokégear (Flag 156). The Pokégear is also auto-fitted with the Map Card (UpgradePokegear 1) and Radio Card (UpgradePokegear 2).
✓ Mom's dialogue after getting your starter is also modified a bit as the flag is set earlier.

New Bark Town
✓ The trigger for Elm giving you his Pokégear number as you leave town to the left has been changed to check that you've been given the starter (Flag 106) instead of checking for the Pokégear (Flag 156).
✓ Changed the two Marill overworlds to Azurill.
✓ The Lyra/Ethan text after leaving ELm's lab initially cuts out the bit about visiting Mom again (as it's no longer needed).
✓ The Marill on the top floor of Lyra/Ethan's house has been moved out of bounds (as it evolves over the course of the game and it's too annoying to deal with). Lyra/Ethan's dialogue is also edited slightly so it doesn't explicitly mention Marill. Their father's dialogue also no longer says they're playing with their Pokémon.
✓ Between when you first battle Silver and going to Mr. Pokémon's house, a policeman blocks Elm's Lab.

Elm Pokémon Lab
✓ The area is now called "Elm Pokémon Lab" instead of "New Bark Town" for Nuzlocke purposes.

Route 29
✓ The two Cut trees have been moved out of bounds.

Cherrygrove City
✓ Silver now challenges you immediately when you enter the city. His overworld's flag is set to 0 and moved out of bounds so it works. This battle sets the flags to remove him from New Bark and add the temporary policeman there. You're also healed before the battle.
✓ The Guide Gent's initial tour is removed. A Fisherman now instead talks to you as you leave the city, giving you the Fishing Rod (a renamed Old Rod) which is the only rod used in the game.
✓ The triggers for the above events (16499) have been shifted so Silver's battle is value: 0, the fishing event is value: 1, and it's set to value: 2 afterwards.
✓ Added some smashable rocks on the beach which can yield encounters.
✓ Changed lady's text in Pokemon Center that talked about communication things previously.

Route 30 - Mr. Pokémon's House
✓ Before leaving, Mr. Pokémon now calls you over and gifts you an Eevee. This Eevee always has its hidden ability.
✓ This map now has its own header name for Nuzlocke purposes. ("Mr. Pokémon's House")
✓ The Pokégear call you receive after leaving Mr. Pokémon's House has slightly edited dialogue, and gives you a prompt to teleport back to New Bark Town immediately (placing the player right outside Elm's Lab).

Elm Pokémon Lab 2
✓ Elm's dialogue is modified slightly to reflect Mr. Pokémon giving you an Eevee. Elm also gives you 30 x Poké Balls.
✓ Elm's script also sets the variables/flags from the Route 29 tutorial, which stops that tutorial from happening and enables Poké Balls for purchase.

Route 30
✓ Changed Joey's before battle dialogue to explicitly mention the top percentage Rattata. Also moved Joey to be compulsory.
✓ Added a new optional Lass Trainer using a Mickey (11) next to some grass. Moved the other NPC lady.

Route 31
✓ The two Cut trees are moved out of bounds.
✓ Added a compulsory Hiker using a Mickey (19) to the left of Dark Cave.
✓ Added another Lass using a Mickey (40).
✓ Ethan/Lyra now battle you when they encounter you in the gatehouse (this battle does not have to be won). Afterwards, they give you TM54, False Swipe (and a quick nod to headbutting/exotic sound encounters) before leaving. The Marill is also an Azurill.
✓ NPC just outside Dark Cave has had his dialogue modified to remove the Flash mention.

Dark Cave - Violet Side
✓ The cave is now low lighting instead of pitch black, so Flash does nothing.
✓ The Strength boulder initially blocking the right half has been moved.
✓ An NPC blocks the northern part until the player visits Blackthorn City.

Violet City
✓ The school has new two NPCs who battle you at the top right. The left gives you a Silk Scarf, the right gives you TM83 Work Up.
✓ Primo has been changed to give you a Pansage, Pansear or Panpour, depending on how you answer his question.
✓ Changed the Juggler outside the Pokémon Center to sell you a berry set for $1,000 containing 5 each of the Cheri, Chesto, Pecha, Rawst, Aspear, Leppa, Oran and Persim Berries.
✓ Edited dialogue of two NPCs, in a house and in the Pokémon Center, to remove text saying traded Pokémon would disobey (as that mechanic has been removed in Aurora Crystal).
✓ Added an NPC and an Eevee in the Pokémon Center who asks you what she should evolve her Eevee into. Picking a specific Eeveelution will make the Mystery Stone always evolve Eevee into the chosen one.
✓ The Kimono Girl who talks to you after collecting Togepi's Egg now gives you a Mystery Stone, a new item that can evolve Eevee into any of its eight evolutions at random (unless set by the NPC above).
✓ Earl now gives you a Sitrus Berry before leading you to the school if you answer "No".

Sprout Tower
✓ The tile permissions have been changed so battles now display an indoor floor instead of a cave.
✓ Both floors now use the same encounter file.
✓ Added an old woman on the ground floor who gives you a Cleanse Tag.
✓ Added an old woman on the top floor who heals you.
✓ Changed Sage Edmond to face down so he's forced.
✓ Rearranged the trainer positions on the top floor to force them all and allow a double battle for the last two.
✓ Added a Hoothoot next to the Elder with a mild Vietnamese Crystal reference (wild hehe jump out).
✓ The Elder now awards you TM10, Hidden Power. One of the top floor monk's dialogues has been modified to reflect this too.

Violet City - Gym
✓ Added two new Trainers using Mickey (63, 87). Set flags for these after beating Falkner.
✓ Updated Falkner's dialogue because of obedience/TM mechanic changes.

Route 36
✓ Split the route into West/East. Added grass to the east of Sudowoodo.
✓ Modified Rock Smash guy's dialogue to reflect that someone else gives you HM06.

Ruins of Alph
✓ Added a patch of grass accessible immediately.
✓ The interior music is now used everywhere else in the RoA as well.
✓ Added a ton of smashable rocks to make fossil hunting easier.
✓ Smashing rocks here now gives a chance for the Gen 1-4 fossils and Rare Bones.
✓ Added a static Sigilyph encounter at the bottom right, Surf required. It doesn't disappear unless caught.
✓ Changed the Hyper Potion at the top left to a Rare Bone, giving the player a fossil of their choice for free.
✓ Added a Ruin Maniac Trainer using a Mickey (105).

Ruins Research Center
✓ This is the building inside the Ruins of Alph, which now has its own header name.
✓ Added another scientist NPC who can revive fossils. Fossils match the correct Pokémon; Aerodactyl is Lv. 40, Gen 5-6 ones are Lv. 25, the rest are Lv. 25 with the Plain Badge, Lv. 10 without.
✓ Moved one of the other scientists to the bookcases to get him out of the way.
✓ Added a Ruin Maniac NPC who will give you any of the fossils in exchange for a Rare Bone (which can be found at a low rate by smashing rocks in the Ruins of Alph). The Gen 5-6 fossils require 3 Badges, Aerodactyl requires 7 Badges.

Route 46
✓ Added a Rare Candy just above the ledge, accessible from Dark Cave.
✓ Moved Hiker Bailey up so you can fight him + the two other Trainers in one go at the ledges if you like.

Route 45

✓ Modified the map of the southern part to remove some ledges, letting some grass be accessible earlier.
✓ Changed the Revive to TM40 Aerial Ace and moved it next to the river, moving the hidden item where the Revive was.
✓ Moved a Hiker that would be accessible from the new area above a ledge.

Route 32
✓ Split the route into North/South areas.
✓ The blocker person now gives you HM06 Rock Smash instead of a Miracle Seed, complete with a quick tutorial about how HMs work in AC.

✓ Added Black Belt Hideki with a Mickey (106) on B1F, blocking TM39.
✓ Changed the Awakening to a Hard Stone and moved it slightly.
✓ Added an Oval Stone item ball on the little island in the pond on 1F.

✓ No changes.

Azalea Town
✓ Added Prof Elm's assistant in the Poké Mart, who will give a Lv. 5 starter of the player's choice.
✓ Added a burglar next to Kurt's house who gives TM46.
✓ Kurt now gives you HM01 instead of a Fast Ball.
✓ Kurt now instantly makes the respective Poké Balls when he's given apricorns instead of it being a daily event.
✓ The charcoal makers will now give you the Charcoal immediately after defeating Team Rocket in the well.

Slowpoke Well
✓ Added an extra Rocket Grunt F using Mickey (141).
✓ Removed the Strength boulder and moved Proton further on. Adjusted movement scripts to match.

✓ Modified Bugsy's dialogue a bit.

Ilex Forest
✓ Shifted all of the triggers/overworlds involving the Farfetch'd thing to the bottom left, out of bounds. Annoying to do on replays.
✓ Removed the Headbutt guy and replaced him with a guaranteed shiny Noctowl at Level 20. The Noctowl overworld should also be shiny (but this has to be manually applied, annoyingly!).  
✓ X Attack is now a Silver Powder.
✓ Ether is now TM86 Grass Knot.
✓ Added a Bug Catcher (as a reference to Crystal) using a Mickey (165).
✓ Added an Ace Trainer F using a Mickey (166).

✓ Added an old woman that heals your Pokémon in the gatehouse.
✓ Made some trainers compulsory. The policeman will now challenge you at any time of day (removed the second one that swaps out with him).
✓ Added an item ball with the Mystic Water.
✓ Added an Ethan/Lyra battle on top of the existing script.

Goldenrod City
✓ Added an NPC in the Game Corner who can sell you coins for money.
✓ Changed the purchasable Pokémon to be Abra, Clefairy and Porygon.
✓ Added an item ball for TM41 Torment inside the Game Corner.
✓ The Frustration/Return lady on Dept Store 5F now tutors the moves instead of giving a TM. She'll tutor the first Pokémon alive in your party (the one following you). If the Pokémon has 51 or more friendship, she'll offer to teach it Return. If it has 50 or less, she'll offer to teach it Frustration. If the Pokémon is unable to learn Return/Frustration, she won't teach anything.
✓ NPC on 5F's dialogue is edited as she previously referenced the above lady giving TMs. Another NPC's dialogue is also edited as it referenced being unable to change nicknames on traded Pokémon.
✓ 5F now sells most of the evolution stones except for the Shiny, Dusk and Dawn Stones. All instances of "TM Corner" in the text are changed to "Stone Emporium".
✓ Daily Drawing Corner on 6F now awards PP Up as the first prize on every day.
✓ The Bike Shop is now a "property for sale". Inside you find the Karate King who is looking at the property and will challenge you to a battle. Defeating him yields a Lv. 15 Tyrogue. There's also a second NPC in the room for some extra context.
✓ Items changed in Dept Store basement. Burn Heal -> Amulet Coin, Ultra Ball -> Scope Lens. Ether -> TM57 Charge Beam.
✓ Edited NPC in city's dialogue that mentioned Bike Shop. Also edited one that talked about the name rater.
✓ Name Rater tent is now a Fortune Teller tent. The NPC inside awards you a Twisted Spoon and then just waffles. Maybe I could do something more here?
✓ NPC blocking Whitney's Gym has changed dialogue to reflect her being at the Pokéathlon Dome instead.
✓ Whitney is no longer in the Radio Tower. Additionally, the Radio Tower quiz doesn't happen.
✓ TM49 Echoed Voice is on the first floor of the Radio Tower.
✓ Added an NPC in the train station who gives you a Magnet.
✓ Edited dialogue in the PC that mentioned communication stuff.

Goldenrod Tunnel
✓ The four shopping NPCs now show up every day of the week.
✓ Added an item ball for TM09 Venoshock.

Global Terminal
✓ Changed the monitors on the ground floor to have a new script that lets you exchange a Pokémon for a regional species. There's a monitor each for Alola, Galar, Hisui and Paldea. The scripts are in place for the first three. The latter three are currently disabled as assets are missing (and in Paldea's case, the Pokémon data too), and just display an 'error' text. Alola all works fine though!
✓ Moved a bunch of NPCs whose dialogue no longer makes sense off the map.
✓ Modified some dialogue to remove GTS references and/or say it is closed.
✓ Blocked off the teleporters to the upper floors.
✓ Added a new NPC with an Alola Sandshrew overworld to advertise the regionals.

Route 35
✓ Rearranged a bunch of Trainers to make them compulsory.
✓ Added a new Ace Trainer using a Mickey (167).
✓ Changed text of Picnicker Kim to mention the Global Terminal (she has Alolan Vulpix).

National Park
✓ Made the BCC staff appear all the time. Changed the script to always allow the BCC and assume it's Tuesday by modifying Function#3 in Script File 151 to remove the daily flag check (2727) and set the day of week variable to always be 2 (Tuesday).
✓ Pokémon caught in the BCC now list their location as "Bug-Catching Contest". Normal encounters still say "National Park".
✓ The BCC uses the Tuesday National Dex settings (though the encounters are changed). The prizes have been modified at the script level (Script File 151) to reroll if it picks a Shiny/Dusk/Dawn Stone, give an Ice Stone if it rolls the Oval Stone, and give an Oran Berry if it would give a Shed Shell.
✓ The first time you compete in the BCC, you receive TM32 Leech Life.
✓ Soothe Bell changed to Miracle Seed.

Pokéathlon Dome
✓ Whitney is now visibly at the counter. Talk to her to 'get' a jersey, then she'll return to and unlock Goldenrod Gym.
✓ Magnus gives you a Muscle Band when you talk to him initially.
✓ Added TM27 Low Sweep on the lower end of the map.

Goldenrod City - Gym
✓ Added two new Trainers, a Hiker (168) and an Ace Trainer (169) using Mickeys.
✓ Changed Whitney's dialogue a little bit to reflect new event order.

Ecruteak City
✓ Added an NPC at at the top right of town who gives TM21 Dazzling Gleam.
✓ Added an item ball with a Spell Tag at the top left of town. Moved an old man to stop him blocking it.
✓ Morty now blocks Burned Tower until some events in Ice Path.

Mt. Mortar
✓ The central room now has a Kimono Girl event that forces you to explore the room as far as possible.

Miscellaneous
✓ Scripts for overworld usage of HMs has been adjusted.
✓✓ Script #15 and Function #25 now simply check the starter has been given (Flag 106) and will instantly headbutt a tree if this passes.
✓✓ Script #2 and Function #5 now check for HM06 in the Bag and the Zephyr Badge, and will instantly smash a rock if this passes.
✓✓ Script #1 and Function #2 now check for HM01 in the Bag and the Hive Badge, and will instantly cut a tree if this passes.

✓ Added common scripts for use in the Pokémon Center. (Referred to as 9018, 9019, 9020 ingame.) They're used on a Waiter, Maid and Waiter respectively (OW 59 and OW 60).
✓✓ One script handles changing things about Pokémon, including move tutors, move reminding, move deletion, nicknaming and checking Hidden Power. The move tutors use Script File 2 still but it's been somewhat adapted.
✓✓ One script handles the new "Wonder Egg" mechanic, letting a player give up a Pokémon in exchange for an Egg which can contain any Pokémon in the game that can hatch from an Egg that's also a base form and is not a legendary (i.e. not Phione or Manaphy). Significant alt forms (Alola forms) and Basculin's blue form are added as an extra entry, whereas Frillish, Flabébé and Shellos decide their form after they get picked.
✓✓ One script handles the training NPC, who allows you to train up your levels (with varying Happiny line teams depending on badge count), stats (with full teams of 3 EV awarding Pokémon), or get a status applied to your Pokémon (using a Smeargle with the appropriate status move).

✓ The Pokémon Music channel is edited to play what was the Hoenn Sound at any time/day of the week. The text listed when this plays has also been modified.
