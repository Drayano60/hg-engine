Move Changes
-------------------
Aurora Crystal features moves from the original Heart Gold and Soul Silver as well as additional moves. On top of this, the numerical values of all moves have been updated to be as they are as of Scarlet & Violet. Move effects have also been modified to match Scarlet & Violet where possible; these are explicitly listed as a move change.

Some moves have also received further changes which are listed below. Changes are shown relative to a move's values after being updated to modern generation mechanics.

-------------------
Newly Added Moves
-------------------
Aurora Crystal contains 105 new moves in addition to the 467 in Heart Gold and Soul Silver normally. 100 of these are moves that were introduced in later generation games, and the remaining 5 are custom signature moves for a few Pokémon.

-------------------
New Moves
-------------------

Soothing Aroma
-------------------
Soothing Aroma is a new signature move for Meganium.
It's a status Grass-type move with 100% accuracy and 20 PP that targets both opponents.
Any Pokémon hit by this move will have its Attack and Special Attack lowered by 1 stage.

This move is inspired by Meganium's Pokédex entries mentioning it can "calm aggressive feelings".

Infernal Blast
-------------------
Infernal Blast is a new signature move for Typhlosion.
It's a special Fire-type move with 100 base power, 75% accuracy and 5 PP that targets all Pokémon on the field.
Any Pokémon hit by this move has a 50% chance of becoming burned.

The move is inspired by Typhlosion's Pokédex entries mentioning it can "rub its blazing fur together to cause huge explosions". The "Infernal" part of the name is also a parallel to Hisuian Typhlosion's Infernal Parade move.

Savage Rend
-------------------
Savage Rend is a new signature move for Feraligatr.
It's a physical Water-type move with 80 base power, 100% accuracy and 10 PP that targets one Pokémon.
Any Pokémon hit by this move will have its Defense lowered by 1 stage.
This move has 33% increased power (becoming 106 BP) if used by a Pokémon with Strong Jaw.

This move is inspired by Feraligatr's Pokédex entries mentioning it "savagely tears its victim up".

Piddly Punches
-------------------
Piddly Punches is a new signature move for Ledian.
It's a physical Bug-type move with 10 base power, 90% accuracy and 10 PP that targets one Pokémon.
This move will continue hitting until it either misses or has hit 10 times in a row.
Each hit of this move has 33% increased power (each hit becomes 13 BP) if used by a Pokémon with Iron Fist.

This move is inspired by Ledian's Pokédex entries mentioning it throws a large quantity of "piddly" punches. Mechanically, it's based on (but not identical) to Maushold's Population Bomb.

Splash Crash
-------------------
Splash Crash is a new signature move for Wailord.
It's a physical Water-type move with variable power, 100% accuracy and 10 PP.
It targets a single other Pokémon on the field.
The power of this move depends on the weight difference between user and target (using the same formula as Heavy Slam). Its damage is doubled if used against a target that has used Minimize.
This move becomes a fixed 120 BP if used by a Pokémon with the new Huge Impact ability (which Wailord also has).

This move is inspired by Wailord's Pokédex entries mentioning it can "knock out opponents with the shock created by breaching and crashing its big body into the water". It's a Water-type clone of Heavy Slam.

-------------------
Move Effect Updates
-------------------
The following moves have had their effects updated to work as they do in later generations:

G1
-------------------
- Growth: Boosts both Atk and Sp. Atk by 1 stage, but by 2 stages in sunlight.
- Minimize: Boosts evasion by 2 stages instead of 1.
- Roar: Level check in wild battles; no failure chance in trainer battles; ignores Protect/Detect.
- String Shot: Drops speed by 2 stages instead of 1.
- Teleport: Now switches out the user in a Trainer battle, has -6 priority. Ends wild battles.
- Toxic: Now always hits if used by a Poison-type Pokémon.
- Whirlwind: Level check in wild battles; no failure chance in trainer battles; ignores Protect/Detect.

G2
-------------------
- Hidden Power: Now fixed at 60 base power; the type is still determined by the user's IVs.
- Rapid Spin: Now boosts the user's Speed by one stage in addition to its hazard removal.

G4
-------------------
- Chatter: Now always confuses the opponent.
- Feint: Still works even if the opponent doesn't use Protect or Detect.

The following moves have their effects somewhat updated to work as they do in later generations:

G3
-------------------
- Knock Off: Now does double damage if it knocks off an item. However, it still "disables" the item during the battle instead of outright deleting it, as the item would otherwise be lost permanently.

G4
-------------------
- Dragon Rush: Now does double damage if the opponent has used Minimize. However, it is not a guaranteed hit in that case.

The following moves have NOT had their effects updated and still work as they do in Heart Gold and Soul Silver:

G1
-------------------
- Stomp: This does not have a guaranteed hit against minimized targets.

G2
-------------------
- Beat Up: This still uses the original damage calculation.
- Conversion 2: The effect is still based on the last move the Pokémon was hit with.

G3
-------------------
- Tail Glow: This does not boost Sp. Atk by 3 stages, it still only does 2 stages.

The following moves brought in from later generations have not been implemented completely accurately (and were not intentionally changed):

G5
-------------------
- Cotton Guard: This boosts Defense by 2 stages, instead of 3 stages.
- Echoed Voice: The move's power doubles for each turn of consecutive use (to a maximum of 200 BP), but this happens irrespective of whether other Pokémon use Echoed Voice.

G6
-------------------
- Freeze-Dry: This is not super-effective against Water-types, but it does do quadruple damage against Water-types for roughly the same result.

G7
-------------------
- Aurora Veil: It sets up a Reflect and Light Screen in the same turn, instead of it being its own field effect. However, the damage reduction should be the same. It still has the restriction of only working within Hail.

G8
-------------------
- Scale Shot: The stat change happens after the first hit instead of the last, but is otherwise the same.

G9
-------------------
- Ice Spinner: This now has no additional effect, as terrains don't exist in this game.
- Raging Bull: This is now always a Normal-type move. Paldean Tauros isn't in the game anyway though!

The following moves have been given new effects:

G1
-------------------
- Cut: Now has a high critical-hit ratio.
- Drill Peck: Now has a high critical-hit ratio.
- Meditate: Now boosts Attack and accuracy by one stage each.
- Razor Wind: This is now a one-turn move. It still has a high critical-hit ratio.
- Strength: Now has a chance (20%) to boost the user's Attack stat by one stage.

G2
-------------------
- Triple Kick: Now gains +15 base power on each consecutive hit (raised from +10).

G3
-------------------
- Dive: This is now a one-turn move with no additional effect.
- Needle Arm: This now adds a layer of Spikes to the target's field if it hits. It no longer has a chance to poison.

G4
-------------------
- Dragon Claw: Now has a high critical-hit ratio (copied from Legends: Arceus).
- Power Gem: Now has a chance (10%) to lower the target's Special Defense by 1 stage.
- X-Scissor: Now has a high critical-hit ratio (copied from Legends: Arceus).

G6
-------------------
- Draining Kiss: Now heals the user by 50% of the damage dealt (instead of 75%).

G7
-------------------
- Pollen Puff: Now has a chance (30%) to lower the target's Speed by 1 stage. It does not heal an ally's HP.

G8
-------------------
- Meteor Beam: Now a one-turn move. It has a chance (20%) to raise the user's Special Attack stat by one stage (instead of having a charge turn with a Sp. Atk boost).

G9
-------------------
- Rage Fist: This instead works like the move Rage, where the user's Attack is boosted if it gets hit after using Rage Fist, as the original effect can't currently be implemented.
