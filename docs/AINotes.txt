"This now deals 50% more damage to a target with a held item that isn't the Griseous Orb or a Pokémon with the Multitype ability.
However, it still makes the item unusable instead of removing it entirely, as otherwise the item would be lost forever.
(A Pokémon whose item has been knocked off is still treated as not having an item for things like Acrobatics, Unburden etc, and is unable to gain another item even if it uses Thief, Trick etc.)"

Toxic now looks at regular poison ai

Status moves vs immunities:
- The AI doesn't assign scores based on type calculation for all moves. It does for all attacking moves, but for status moves only certain eff_seqs get the check.
- One of these if eff 67 (paralysis) which is why Thunder Wave correctly avoids hitting Ground-types, and why Glare/Stun Spore can end up doing the same thing when allowing access to the type calculation function.

I tried a few things to get other moves to work, but...
- Setting status to base power 1 doesn't work as it doesn't check for type effectiveness.
- The base power 1 moves have a separate AI script that checks for type effectiveness, but it would end up replacing checks for things like abilities.
- Setting status to base power 2 doesn't work as it then gives a -1 score to the status move for not being the top damage.
- There doesn't seem to be any way to get the status move to check immunities but not penalize for a neutral matchup unfortunately...
- On the bright side, the paralysis eff_seq does already factor in a type check, so I can use Stun Spore I guess? I could swap other moves to use the eff_seq, but it'll then play by the same rules as Thunder Wave (notably the speed bit and ability checks...)

In the end I have protection against Stun Spore vs Grass-types/Overcoat and paralysis against Electrics in general, but that's it.
