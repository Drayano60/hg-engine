Essentials:
- [ ] Do a pass over all Trainers, introduce Gen 7-9 mons to teams etc. Need to also sort out teams for E4 rematches, possibly Gym Leader rematches?
- [ ] Decide on the exact requirements on Arceus (at the very least, how many Pokémon need to be obtained.)
- [ ] Add battle sprites for the available Pokémon still missing them, like Rockruff, Bounsweet, Steenee, and the three Paldean Tauros.
- [ ] Figure out what to do about overworld sprites for Gen 9.
- [ ] Testing!!

Stretch Goals:
- [ ] Add content for the Fighting Dojo.
- [ ] Add new maps for the two new environments in the Safari Zone.
