Befuddle|Butterfree|Bug-type moves have a 30% chance to inflict poison, paralysis or sleep.|A reference to G-Max Befuddle, the special move for Butterfree's Gigantamax form.

Heat Up|Cyndaquil, Quilava, Typhlosion|This Pokémon's Sp. Atk is raised by one stage when it faints a foe with a damaging move.|Very loosely based off Ash's Cyndaquil needing to heat up in the anime, and not having any better ideas!

Infernal Body|Slugma, Magcargo|A foe using a contact move on this Pokémon will be burned.|A guaranteed-to-work clone of Flame Body, due to their incredibly hot bodies.
Royal Order|Vespiquen|This Pokémon takes x0.5 reduced damage when at full HP.|A clone of Multiscale. Based on an idea of the Combee soldiers defending it from the initial hit.
Totter Steps|Spinda|Moves used against the Pokémon have an accuracy modifier of x0.8.|Based on Spinda's Pokédex entries saying it evades moves with its stumbling movements.

## Changes to Existing Abilities

Abilities|New Effect|Notes
---|---|---
Blaze, Overgrow, Swarm, Torrent|Now gives a permanent x1.2 boost to moves of the relevant type. This is increased to the usual x1.5 when the Pokémon is at or below a third of its HP.|This is to make the pinch abilities feel less useless in most situations. This idea is from Inclement Emerald - thanks, Buffel Saft!
Iron Fist, Mega Launcher, Reckless, Sharpness, Strong Jaw|All of these abilities now increase the power of the relevant moves by x1.33.|These are all abilities that boost certain moves, and the boost has been standardized. Iron Fist and Reckless are buffed, the rest have had a nerf due to their greater availability.
Illuminate, Keen Eye|These abilities now also increase move accuracy by x1.2, in addition to their usual effects.|These abilities have minimal effect normally, and both make sense as an accuracy boost. The accuracy boost is not quite as big as Compound Eyes's because stronger Pokémon get the abilities.
Rivalry|Now increases move power against opposite gender foes by x1.2. It no longer reduces move power against same gender foes.|The negative effect has been removed to make this ability a lot more usable, but it's been nerfed slightly as a result.
Magma Armor|Now halves the damage taken from Water or Ice-type moves, in addition to preventing the Pokémon from being frozen.|A little bonus based on the superhot temperature of magma to help with Magcargo and Camerupt's Water weakness. A full immunity ability would be better, but the AI would handle it incredibly poorly!
Sand Stream|Now also grants immunity to Sandstorm damage, in addition to summoning a sandstorm.|This is a slight addition for Flygon's benefit; this way it can use Sand Stream and avoid chip damage without its Ground-type.
Tough Claws|Now increases the power of contact moves by x1.2.|Nerfed from x1.3 due to much greater availability, as well as nearly outclassing abilities like Iron Fist at its regular power.
