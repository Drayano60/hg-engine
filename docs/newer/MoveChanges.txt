Move Modernization
===========================================================================
Thanks to hg-engine, most moves that gained new battle effects in later generations have had these changes backported to HG/SS.
As hg-engine is still an ongoing project, some moves have not been fully modernized yet.

[Moves Fully Modernized]
- Binding moves (Wrap, Clamp etc) deal 1/8 damage per turn and last for 4-5 turns (or 7 with a Grip Claw).
- Body Slam, Dragon Rush and Stomp now deal double damage and cannot miss against a target that has used Minimize.
- Chatter now has a guaranteed confusion effect.
- Defog now clears terrains, and any hazards on the user's side of the field.
- Explosion and Self-Destruct no longer half the target's Defense stat during damage calculation.
- Facade's damage is no longer affected by the Attack cutting effect of a burn.
- Feint can now also damage a target that isn't using Protect or Detect.
- Fury Cutter now maxes out at 160 BP after three uses, and the damage also resets properly if a different move is used.
- Growth now raises both the Attack and Special Attack stats, and the effect is doubled in harsh sunlight.
- Hidden Power's power is now fixed at 60 BP.
- High Jump Kick and Jump Kick's crash damage is now equal to half of the user's max HP (instead of half the damage that would be dealt).
- Knock Off now fully removes the opponent's item, and will gain the 50% damage boost when it would do so (even if the target has Sticky Hold).
- Minimize now raises the user's evasion by two stages.
- Natural Gift uses the modernized base power of Berries when calculating damage.
- Rapid Spin now also boosts the user's Speed stat by one stage.
- Roar and Whirlwind now fail against higher leveled opponents in Wild Battles, and will always work in a Trainer Battle.
- Role Play is now unable to copy certain abilities.
- String Shot now lowers a target's Speed stat by two stages.
- Substitute no longer blocks damage from sound-based moves.
- Sweet Scent now lowers a target's evasion by two stages.
- Tail Glow now raises a user's Special Attack stat by three stages.
- Tailwind now lasts for four turns.
- Teleport now has negative priority, and allows a Pokémon to switch out in a Trainer Battle.
- Toxic will now always hit if used by a Poison-type Pokémon, even if the target is otherwise invulnerable.

[Moves Partially Modernized]
- Beat Up now uses the modern damage formula, but still deals typeless damage.
- Disable, Encore and Taunt now always last for 4, 3 and 3 turns respectively. However, this is overall turns (not including the turn the effect is applied) instead of for 4/3/3 of the affected Pokémon's moves. Additionally, a Pokémon under the effect of Encore cannot yet select its target in a double battle.
- Mud Sport and Water Sport now reduce the respective type damage by 2/3. However, the effect is still permanent and only until the user switches out.
- Sheer Cold is now ineffective against Ice-type Pokémon. However, its accuracy is not currently reduced if used by a Pokémon that isn't an Ice-type.
- Uproar's continuous effect now always lasts for three turns. However, its side effects are still affected by Soundproof.

[Moves Not Yet Modernized]
- Aromatherapy, Conversion, Conversion2, Doom Desire, Healing Wish, Future Sight, Heal Block, Psywave and Wish still work exactly the same as Generation IV. 
- Baton Pass still passes on the effect of Mean Look.
- Dark Void can still be used by any Pokémon.
- Destiny Bond does not have a chance of failing on consecutive uses.
- Fling can still be used by a Pokémon with the Klutz ability.
- Imprison still does not fail when the user shares no moves with its opponent(s).
- Me First still cannot be selected if the would-be user is under the effect of Taunt.
- Multi-hit moves (Double Slap, Rock Blast etc) still have the same chance to hit 2/3/4/5 times as Generation IV.
- Pay Day's payout is still determined by the Pokémon's level at the time of use instead of its level at the end of the battle.
- Payback's damage is still doubled against an opponent that switches in on the same turn.
- Psych Up does not yet copy the effect of Focus Energy.
- Rampage moves (Thrash, Outrage etc) do not yet cancel if the move fails to connect for whatever reason.
- Roost does not make a pure Flying-type into a Normal-type yet. Instead, it effectively becomes typeless during damage calculation.
- Sketch is still able to copy Dark Void.

- Dragon Cheer applies the +2 critical ratio boost regardless of if the target is a Dragon-type or not.
- Rage Fist's damage boost resets if the Pokémon switches out.
- Syrup Bomb's effect is an immediate -2 Speed stat drop, instead of being at the end of the turn for the next three turns.

Effect: Has a chance (30%) to flinch the target. Has a chance (30%) to lower the target's Defense stat. Has a high critical-hit ratio (+1).
(It's difficult to have separate effect chances for each effect, so the 50% chance to lower the target's Defense stat is 30% instead.)

[Wild Charge]
Power: 90 -> 120
Effect: Has a chance (10%) to paralyze the target. The user takes recoil equal to 1/3 of the damage dealt.
