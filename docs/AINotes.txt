"This now deals 50% more damage to a target with a held item that isn't the Griseous Orb or a Pokémon with the Multitype ability.
However, it still makes the item unusable instead of removing it entirely, as otherwise the item would be lost forever.
(A Pokémon whose item has been knocked off is still treated as not having an item for things like Acrobatics, Unburden etc, and is unable to gain another item even if it uses Thief, Trick etc.)"
